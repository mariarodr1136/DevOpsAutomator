## Technologies Used
- Python/Bash
- Docker
- Kubernetes
- Terraform

## Features
- Automated deployment pipeline with Python or Bash scripts
- Docker containerization for applications
- Kubernetes deployment and service configuration
- Terraform infrastructure provisioning

---

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/mariarodr1136/DevOpsAutomator.git
cd DevOpsAutomator

### 2. Ensure prerequisites are met
Before running the scripts, make sure the following tools are installed and configured on your machine:

#### 2.1 Docker
Docker is required for containerization and managing application deployment.
- [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- Verify installation:
docker --version

#### 2.2 Kubernetes (Minikube or kubeadm)
Kubernetes is used for orchestrating containers in the deployment.
- Install Minikube
- Verify installation:
kubectl version --client

#### 2.3 Terraform
Terraform is used for provisioning infrastructure on cloud platforms.
- Install Terraform
- Verify installation:
terraform --version

#### 2.4 AWS CLI (Optional, for AWS infrastructure)
If using AWS as the provider for Terraform, configure the AWS CLI.
- Install AWS CLI
- Configure AWS CLI:
aws configure

#### 2.5 Python (for Python automation scripts)
If using Python automation scripts, make sure Python 3 is installed.
- Install Python
- Verify installation:
python3 --version

#### 2.6 Docker Compose
Docker Compose is used to manage multi-container Docker applications.
- Install Docker Compose
- Verify installation:
docker-compose --version

---

## 3. Setup Instructions

#### 3.1 Build Docker images
To build the Docker image, navigate to the Docker directory and use the docker-compose command:
docker-compose build

#### 3.2 Configure Kubernetes
Ensure that your Kubernetes cluster is up and running. You can use Minikube or a managed Kubernetes service like GKE or EKS.

For Minikube:
minikube start
kubectl config use-context minikube

#### 3.3 Initialize Terraform
If you're provisioning infrastructure on AWS or another cloud provider, navigate to the Terraform directory and initialize Terraform:
cd Terraform
terraform init

#### 3.4 Run the Automation Script
To deploy your application and provision the infrastructure, you can either use the Python or Bash script.

- Using Python:
python3 Scripts/deploy_pipeline.py

- Using Bash:
bash Scripts/provision_infrastructure.sh

#### 3.5 Access Your Application
Once the deployment is complete, you can access your application depending on how the Kubernetes services are configured:

- If you're using a LoadBalancer type service, check the external IP:
kubectl get services

- If you're using Minikube, you can access the application through the Minikube service URL:
minikube service myapp-service --url

## Notes

- The Terraform script currently provisions an EC2 instance in AWS. Modify the main.tf file for additional infrastructure setups (e.g., VPC, S3, etc.).
- The Kubernetes configurations are set for a basic app deployment, but you can modify the deployment.yaml to include environment variables, secrets, or additional configurations like autoscaling.
- Docker Compose is set to run the containerized app on localhost:5000. Modify the ports in the docker-compose.yml file if needed.

---

## Troubleshooting

- Docker errors: If you encounter issues with Docker, ensure that Docker is running and properly configured. 
  - Check Docker logs for more details:
docker logs <container_id>

- Kubernetes errors: Check the status of Kubernetes pods and services with:
kubectl get pods
kubectl get services

- Terraform errors: Terraform errors can often be related to missing provider credentials or syntax issues in the .tf files. Ensure your credentials are configured correctly and try re-running the Terraform commands.
